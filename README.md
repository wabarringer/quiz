Washington State Quiz

Description
-----------

A quiz of 5 questions on Washington State.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your
project. Use the following questions as a guide:

-   What was your motivation? I was motivated to learn more about
    JavaScript and get more experience in writing code
-   Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it
    was a homework assignment.") On top of learning more and gaining
    more experience, I wanted to create a web based quiz
-   What problem does it solve? It provides a fun way to learn about the
    state of Washington
-   What did you learn? I learned how to store and pull data from local
    storage. I also learned how to properly use event listeners.
